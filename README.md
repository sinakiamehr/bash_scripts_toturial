# 🧪 FreeCodeCamp: Bash Scripting Projects

This repository contains five Bash scripts created as part of the **"Build Five Programs"** module on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Each script demonstrates different aspects of Bash scripting including user input, loops, conditionals, and randomness.

## 📜 Scripts Overview

### 1. `questionnaire.sh`
A short interactive script that asks the user a series of questions and prints customized responses based on their answers.

### 2. `countdown.sh`
A simple countdown timer that takes a starting number and prints numbers decreasing to zero with a delay between each.

### 3. `bingo.sh`
Simulates drawing random Bingo numbers (B-I-N-G-O with numbers in correct ranges). No repeats — each number is unique per run.

### 4. `fortune.sh`
Prints a random fortune or quote from a predefined list. A lightweight version of the classic Unix `fortune` command.

### 5. `five.sh`
A utility script that prints the numbers 1 through 5 using a loop. A basic demonstration of Bash control structures.
